# INST737_Group_Project
Completed by Michael Rakhamimov and Jonathan Ha.

In order to use the R code you will need the dataset file "FinalCleanedDataset.csv" as well as the "CryptoAnalysis_INST737_GroupProject.R" file, which contains the R analysis. Additionally, when importing the CSV into R you will need to change the path to your local working directory and make sure that the CSV file is stored locally inside the same directory. Once these steps have been completed, all of the code can be run revealing our analyses.
