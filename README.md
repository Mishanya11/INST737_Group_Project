# INST737_Group_Project
Completed by Michael Rakhamimov and Jonathan Ha.

In order to use the R code you will need the dataset file "FinalCleanedDataset.csv" as well as the "CryptoAnalysis_INST737_GroupProject.R" file, which contains the R analysis. Additionally, when importing the CSV into R you will need to change the path to your local working directory and make sure that the CSV file is stored locally inside the same directory. Once these steps have been completed, all of the code can be run revealing our analyses.

In order to run the Python code, you will need two dataset files, "CleanedMergedCryptoSet.csv" and "NASDAQ_HistData.csv" as well as the "INST737_Granger_Test_Code.ipynb" which contains the Python Granger Causality test code. Additionally, you will need to import the .csv files into the directory where you are running the Python code. If running the code using Google colab, simply open the files section on the left and drag both .csv files into it. The code can then be run afterwards. Something to note however, is if you want to test different lags for the Granger test, you have to manually change the variable "maxlag".
